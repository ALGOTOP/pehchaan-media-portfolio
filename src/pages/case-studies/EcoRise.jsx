          EcoRise partnered with Pehchaan Media to develop a global awareness
          campaign centered on clean energy and design-led sustainability. The
          challenge was to make the message emotionally relatable without losing
          scientific accuracy.

          purpose-driven branding across EcoRiseâ€™s digital channels.
